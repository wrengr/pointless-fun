pointless-fun
=============

This is a simple package and should be easy to install. You should
be able to use one of the following standard methods to install it.

    -- With cabal-install and without the source:
    $> cabal install pointless-fun
    
    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:
    $> cd pointless-fun
    $> cabal install
    
    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:
    $> cd pointless-fun
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register

The test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock
step is also optional.


Portability
===========

An attempt has been made to keep this library as portable as possible.
It is fully Haskell98 compliant.
